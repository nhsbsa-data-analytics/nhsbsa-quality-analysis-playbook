Here the analyst creates a plan that sets out how to achieve the purpose and questions that need answered.  It helps highlight any assumptions and known limitations of the proposed approach. It will also take account of any previous or related analysis.  

This may be merged with the Scoping documentation and will also include: 

- Data to be used 

- Methodology including techniques and tools and [models](/guidance/13-types-of-analytical-model.qmd) 

- Approaches to identify, quantify and communicate [uncertainty](/guidance/14-uncertainty.qmd) 

- Assumptions, accuracy, limitations and caveats 

- Ethical, Information governance and data security considerations 

- Outputs 

- Timescales and resources 

- Analytical quality assurance activities 

A prototype could be created at this stage. 

The analyst should ensure that they have applied the [RIGOUR](/guidance/12-RIGOUR.qmd) principles to the plan. They should develop the plan with a mindset that their work will be shared. 

The plan should be agreed, written and shared with the Commissioner, Subject Matter Experts and all relevant stakeholders. It may evolve.  
 

If the Commissioner considers the analysis or model to be Business Critical, it must be logged  with the Data Science, Advanced Analytics and Statistics team. They will add to the public register.

A critical friend/analytical assurer will confirm that the approach meets the commissionerâ€™s needs and answers the questions. They will fully understand any limitations of the analysis and ensure the approach and quality checking are at the right level. 
They will be able to sign off that the approach is fit for purpose. They will do this when confident that the analyst can deliver quality analysis.

The level of analytical quality assurance needed will depend on the: 

-	risks associated with the intended use of the analysis. There could be financial, legal, operational and reputational impacts

-	type and complexity of the analysis 

-	novelty of the analytical approach 

-	importance of the issue 

-	role and criticality of the analysis to the decision-making process 

-	required precision of the analytical outputs

-	amount of resource available for the analysis and the supporting assurance activities 

A formal peer review or analytical quality assurance audit may be done for very complex analysis.
