Here we define the question we want to answer with the analysis. The analyst and commissioner need a clear, shared understanding of the questions to be answered. They must also know what can and cannot be achieved. 

We need to ensure that the following are agreed, written down and shared with the Commissioner and relevant stakeholders: 
 

- Purpose, use of the analysis, and importance of the decision 

- Users of the analysis 

- Scope and boundaries and context 

- Analytical questions 

- Levels of quality, certainty and quality assurance needed 

- Dependencies and complexities 

- How the analysis will be shared - including whether it is is a one-off or regular.  

- Any previous relevant or related analysis 

This may change as insight is gained and the original questions refined. This will inform the analytical plan. 

Here we should also decide if the analysis is business critical. Business critical analysis is where: 

- the analysis informs essential financial and funding decisions 

- the analysis is essential to the achievement of business plan actions and priorities 

- errors could lead to serious financial, legal, reputational damages or penalties 

If analysis is Business Critical it needs to have a single Senior Responsible Owner (SRO). This person may also be the Commissioner.

Appoint a critical friend/analytical assurer who can challenge and test:

- the understanding of the problem
- the requirements, limits, assumptions and scope
- whether sufficient views have been considered
