Once we produce data or analysis, it is important to understand how it is being used. This is especially true if it is updated regularly.  

Activities may include:  

- monitoring any decisions taken or policy changes which the analysis has informed 

- monitoring usage statistics 

- user research to understand ongoing usefulness and usability 

- identifying future improvements to analysis which is regular/ongoing 

- collecting case studies that show how the data has been used 

- monitoring changes in trends, which the data may have influenced 

- decommissioning analysis where it is no longer useful or relevant.
