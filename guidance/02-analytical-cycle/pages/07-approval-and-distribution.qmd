The commissioner must trust the analysis results. This means it must be fit-for-purpose and answer the question asked. They must also understand any [uncertainty](/guidance/14-uncertainty.qmd) associated with the analysis.  And have enough assurance from the quality assurer. 

The commissioner should: 

-	approve the results of the analysis for release
-	ensure appropriate and timely release of the results of the analysis.
-	ensure the results are clear, accessible and transparent. They include appropriate caveats and constraints. This helps ensure people use the results appropriately.
-	make clear any risks or uncertainties and associated level of confidence.

All documentation should be stored centrally.

We must follow NHSBSA accessibility guidelines where data/insights are to be published on internal or external web pages.

Release of Official statistics must follow the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/). The Lead Official for Statistics or an appointed deputy must approve all Official Statistics outputs.

Published or unpublished management information should also follow best practice principles.
