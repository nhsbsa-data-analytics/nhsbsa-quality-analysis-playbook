This includes non-analysts and third-party suppliers.\n\nIt covers all analysis and datasets. This includes analysis and data published externally and used for internal decisions. It also includes analysis/data given to our sponsors/partners.\nThis will ensure quality and consistency of analysis and support well-informed decisions.\nThis Playbook is based on:\n\nGovernment functional standard 010: analysis\nThe Aqua Book: guidance on producing quality analysis for government\nCode of Practice for Statistics\n\nThe Green Book and Magenta Book also cover analysis involving appraisal and evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\n\n Commissioner – the person requesting the analysis. This could be an internal team, external partner or sponsor such as DHSC or NHS England.\nAnalyst – the person planning, undertaking and documenting the analysis. This includes Data Analysts and Performance Analysts. It also includes Customer Insight Officers, Statistical Officers, Statisticians and Data Scientists.\nCritical friend/analytical assurer – the person who signs off that the analysis is fit-for-purpose. This person should not be delivering the analysis. They are usually a Senior Analyst but need not always be an analyst. Ideally, they will have prior knowledge of the subject matter and/or techniques being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items",

    "text": "Repeatable: For an analytical process to be considered ‘valid’ it might reasonably be expected that for the “same” inputs and constraints the analysis produces the “same” outputs. It is important to note that different analysts will consider the analytical problem differently, potentially resulting in differing results, however if any one approach is repeated the results should be as expected.\nIndependent: To produce analysis that is free of prejudice or bias. In doing so, care should be taken to appropriately balance the views across all stakeholders and experts.\nGrounded in reality: Quality analysis takes the commissioner and analyst on a journey as views and perceptions are challenged and connections are made between the analysis and its real consequences. Connecting with reality in this way guards against failing to properly grasp the context of the problem – which is being analysed.\nObjective: Effective engagement and suitable challenge reduces potential bias and enables the commissioner and the analyst to be clear about the interpretation of the analytical results.\nUncertainty-managed: Uncertainties have been identified, managed and communicated throughout the analytical process.\nRobust: Provide the analytical result in the context of residual uncertainty and limitations in order to ensure it is used appropriately."

    "text": "Policy simulation: to better understand policy options that drive government decisions.Ministers make policy decisions. They base them on assessments of the likely cost and impact of policy choices. For example, the Intra Government Tax Benefit Model is used to analyse the distributional impact of tax and benefit changes.\nForecasting: to predict the future and inform today’s policy choices. For example, demographic projections are essential to understand future cost pressures for education and healthcare. Equally, DECC use the updated Energy and Emissions Model to forecast the energy demand and emissions by fuel type and business sector under existing firm and funded policies.\nFinancial evaluation: to better understand future liabilities or costs. For example, modelling to understand the future cost implications of current pension commitments or the future cost of decommissioning existing nuclear energy plants.\nProcurement and commercial evaluation: for the letting and management of large contracts, and to ensure value for money – for example, where a key service is to be contracted out as in the case of railway franchises or where a major IT upgrades/ new system is being introduced.\nPlanning: to make workforce decisions which affect the delivery of future services. For example, these models may be used to assess the number of trainee teachers, doctors and nurses required to deliver education and healthcare into the future.\nScience based: to better understand and simulate the physical environment, in order to evaluate possible solutions or to mitigate potentially devastating impacts – for example, climate change and flood risk.\nAllocation of funds: to determine how funds allocated to departments are then distributed to, for example: local authorities, schools or across the health service. These models are essential to ensure funds are allocated properly across the country to underpin local service delivery.\nConceptual: to help understand the key influences that are important to a system being modelled. A variety of problem-structuring techniques are used to develop conceptual models"
