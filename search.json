It is especially for:\n\nDirectors and Heads of Service to ensure appropriate governance of analysis in their areas.\nCommissioners, users, analysts and analytical assurers. This includes non-analysts and third-party suppliers.\n\nIt covers all analysis and datasets. This includes analysis and data published externally and used for internal decisions. It also includes analysis/data given to our sponsors/partners.\nThis will ensure quality and consistency of analysis and support well-informed decisions.\nThis Playbook is based on:\n\nGovernment functional standard 010: analysis\nThe Aqua Book: guidance on producing quality analysis for government\nCode of Practice for Statistics\n\nThe Green Book and Magenta Book also cover analysis involving appraisal and evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\n\n Commissioner – the person requesting the analysis. This could be an internal team, external partner or sponsor such as DHSC or NHS England.\nAnalyst – the person planning, undertaking and documenting the analysis. This includes Data Analysts and Performance Analysts. It also includes Customer Insight Officers, Statistical Officers, Statisticians and Data Scientists.\nCritical friend/analytical assurer – the person who signs off that the analysis is fit-for-purpose. This person should not be delivering the analysis. They are usually a Senior Analyst but need not always be an analyst. Ideally, they will have prior knowledge of the subject matter and/or techniques being used.\nSenior Responsible Owner (SRO) – the person who takes responsibility of a ‘Business-Critical Model’ resulting from the analysis throughout its lifecycle. The SRO signs-off that a model is fit-for-purpose prior to its use. This may be the Commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items",

    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Uncertainty in Analysis?\nUncertainty describes the difference between an estimate and true value in analysis. It helps to show the limitations of our data, statistics and insights. Uncertainty relates to a range of possible factors that can affect accuracy. This includes the impact of measurement or sampling error, how the data had been collected and analysed, missing data or under-reporting.\n\n\nDirect uncertainty\nDirect uncertainty refers to uncertainty about an estimate (or fact).It can be explicitly measured or quantified during data collection or as part of data analysis. Direct uncertainty can be communicated in absolute terms (such as a standard error, confidence intervals, credible intervals and statistical significance).\n\n\nIndirect uncertainty\nIndirect uncertainty refers to uncertainty about the underlying quality of knowledge that surrounds an estimate (or fact). It is not directly measured or quantified but is inferred from uncertainties associated with the analysis. This will often be communicated as a list of caveats about the underlying statistics or data, or it can be summarised into a qualitative or ordered categorical scale. One such example is the GRADE scale.\n\n\nWhy Uncertainty matters\nA good understanding of sources and levels of uncertainty helps us to recognise how reliable numbers are. It is important to communicate this clearly to enable users to apply appropriate weight to the results of the analysis. This can help to reduce misinterpretation, maintain confidence, and protect the integrity of the data, the analysis, and the communicator.\n\n\nCommunicating uncertainty\n\nBe transparent about any uncertainty to avoid misinterpretation and misuse.\nBe specific about what exactly is uncertain and why, how the uncertainty has been quantified, the limitations of the data and any assumptions made in the analysis.\nUse plain and accessible language to make sure that when you write about uncertainty it can be understood by all.\nShow uncertainty in your data visualisations, datasets, data tables etc and explain to readers what the uncertainty represents. It is not enough to only include in Quality and Methods\n\n\n\nDetailed guidance\nCommunicating quality, uncertainty and change – Government Analysis Function\nApproaches to presenting uncertainty in the statistical system"

    "text": "Repeatable: For an analytical process to be considered ‘valid’ it might reasonably be expected that for the “same” inputs and constraints the analysis produces the “same” outputs. It is important to note that different analysts will consider the analytical problem differently, potentially resulting in differing results, however if any one approach is repeated the results should be as expected.\nIndependent: To produce analysis that is free of prejudice or bias. In doing so, care should be taken to appropriately balance the views across all stakeholders and experts.\nGrounded in reality: Quality analysis takes the commissioner and analyst on a journey as views and perceptions are challenged and connections are made between the analysis and its real consequences. Connecting with reality in this way guards against failing to properly grasp the context of the problem – which is being analysed.\nObjective: Effective engagement and suitable challenge reduces potential bias and enables the commissioner and the analyst to be clear about the interpretation of the analytical results.\nUncertainty-managed: Uncertainties have been identified, managed and communicated throughout the analytical process.\nRobust: Provide the analytical result in the context of residual uncertainty and limitations in order to ensure it is used appropriately."

They base them on assessments of the likely cost and impact of policy choices. For example, the Intra Government Tax Benefit Model is used to analyse the distributional impact of tax and benefit changes.\nForecasting: to predict the future and inform today’s policy choices. For example, demographic projections are essential to understand future cost pressures for education and healthcare. Equally, DECC use the updated Energy and Emissions Model to forecast the energy demand and emissions by fuel type and business sector under existing firm and funded policies.\nFinancial evaluation: to better understand future liabilities or costs. For example, modelling to understand the future cost implications of current pension commitments or the future cost of decommissioning existing nuclear energy plants.\nProcurement and commercial evaluation: for the letting and management of large contracts, and to ensure value for money – for example, where a key service is to be contracted out as in the case of railway franchises or where a major IT upgrades/ new system is being introduced.\nPlanning: to make workforce decisions which affect the delivery of future services. For example, these models may be used to assess the number of trainee teachers, doctors and nurses required to deliver education and healthcare into the future.\nScience based: to better understand and simulate the physical environment, in order to evaluate possible solutions or to mitigate potentially devastating impacts – for example, climate change and flood risk.\nAllocation of funds: to determine how funds allocated to departments are then distributed to, for example: local authorities, schools or across the health service. These models are essential to ensure funds are allocated properly across the country to underpin local service delivery.\nConceptual: to help understand the key influences that are important to a system being modelled.

    "text": "The easiest way is just to open the repo in Github Codespaces - you can then make your changes, run the website to check it, and commit those back all within a VSCode environment.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to use Github codespaces (or can’t because it’s blocked, or you’ve run out of credits), then you can make changes to the repo locally on your machine.\n\n\n\n\nSee the README for guidance on installing the dependencies and getting started with development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the relevant subfolder within guidance (e.g. guidance/03-responsibilities/pages)\nAdd a qmd file with the following header fields: ---     title: \"This is the title of your page\"     description: \"This is a brief description of your page\"     image-alt: \"This text will show if your image can't be displayed\"     image: &lt;name of a .jpg file stored in the same subfolder to use for the card&gt;     ---\nAdd the content below the header using standard markdown syntax.\nA link to the page will be added as a card on the landing page. If you want to show an image on the card, add a jpeg file to the same subfolder as the content and include the name in the header fields as above.\nOnce you are happy with your changes submit a pull request!\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the a subfolder within guidance and name it appropriately (e.g. 04-business-critical-models). Note that the sections will be ordered in the dropdown on the website according to the numbers in front of the subfolders (i.e. first 01- then 02- and so on)\nAdd an index.qmd file to the subfolder (you can use one of the existing files as an example!)\nFollow the steps above to add the new page within the section you’ve just created.\nOnce you are happy with your changes submit a pull request!"
