This playbook sets out the NHSBSA’s expectations for planning and doing analysis. 

It provides direction and guidance for everyone at the NHSBSA. It is especially for: 

- Directors and Heads of Service to ensure appropriate governance of analysis in their areas.  

- Commissioners, users, analysts and analytical assurers. This includes non-analysts and third-party suppliers.  

It covers all analysis and datasets. This includes analysis and data published externally and used for internal decisions. It also includes analysis/data given to our sponsors/partners.

**Data requests** – responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, Parliamentary Questions (PQs), data for sponsors and other adhoc requests.

**Data products and reports** – for colleagues in the NHS, or external partners, including performance data, customer insight reports, operational forecasts and cost/benfit evaluations.

**Open datasets** – such as those on the [Open Data Portal (ODP)](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/).

**Official Statistics** – including [publications and data releases](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections).

**Data Science releases** - including [articles, reports](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/data-science-projects), [models and code](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/data-and-analytics-code-repositories).

This will ensure quality and consistency of analysis and support well-informed decisions. 

This Playbook is based on:
 
- [Government functional standard 010: analysis](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64e4cf0a4002ee000d560d5f/2023.02_GovS_010_Analysis_v2.1.pdf)

- [The Aqua Book: guidance on producing quality analysis for government](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7f3bb8e5274a2e87db49be/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) 

- [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/)

 

The [Green Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-government) and [Magenta Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-magenta-book)  also cover analysis involving appraisal and evaluation.

**Commissioner** – the person requesting the analysis. This could be an internal team, external partner or sponsor such as DHSC or NHS England.

**Analyst** – the person planning, undertaking and documenting the analysis. This includes Data Analysts and Performance Analysts. It also includes Customer Insight Officers, Statistical Officers, Statisticians and Data Scientists.

**Critical friend/analytical assurer** – the person who signs off that the analysis is fit-for-purpose. This person should not be delivering the analysis. They are usually a Senior Analyst but need not always be an analyst. Ideally, they will have prior knowledge of the subject matter and/or techniques being used.

**Senior Responsible Owner (SRO)** – the person who takes responsibility of a ‘Business-Critical Model’ resulting from the analysis throughout its lifecycle. The SRO signs-off that a model is fit-for-purpose prior to its use. This may be the Commissioner.
